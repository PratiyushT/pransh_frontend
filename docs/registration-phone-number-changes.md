## Detailed Changes

### 1. Optional Phone Number Field in Main Registration Form

A new optional phone number field has been added to the main registration form section:

- **Field Label**: "Phone Number (Optional)"
- **Field Type**: Telephone input (`<input type="tel">`)
- **Location**: Placed after the email address field and before the password field

**UI Implementation Details**:

- Placeholder text shows example formatting: "(123) 456-7890"
- Clearly labeled as optional with gray text indicator

### 2. Mandatory Phone Number Field in Shipping Address Section

A required phone number field has been added to the shipping address section:

- **Field Label**: "Phone Number" (with a red asterisk to indicate required)
- **Field Type**: Telephone input (`<input type="tel">`)
- **Location**: Placed at the bottom of the shipping address form
- **Validation**: Required when shipping address is provided
- **Data Storage**: Stored in the user's shipping address metadata

**UI Implementation Details**:
- Displays error message when field is empty and form is submitted
- Only appears when "Add Shipping Address" section is expanded
- Participates in the shipping address section animation

### 3. Updated Form Validation Logic

The validation logic was updated to accommodate the new phone number requirements:

- Added `isPhoneNumberValid` reactive variable to track phone number validation state
- Updated the form's `isFormValid` condition to include phone number validation
- Added phone number validation to the `touchField` function
- Ensures the shipping address phone number is required when shipping address is shown
- Prevents form submission when shipping address is active but phone number is empty
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing validation patterns

### 4. Authentication and Login Flow Improvements

Several improvements were made to the authentication flow:

- Fixed login redirection issue to account page
- Ensured proper storage of user data in localStorage after successful login
- Enhanced logout functionality to properly clear both Supabase session and localStorage
- Improved session management to properly handle authentication state
- Enhanced error handling for authentication errors
- Added async/await support to authentication checking functions
